# 🎯 Russian Roulette (Water Gun Edition)
**CSEC 413 – Modeling and Simulation**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **stochastic game simulation** inspired by the concept of Russian Roulette, redesigned in a safe and appropriate manner by using a **water gun** instead of a real firearm. The game demonstrates how probability and randomness influence outcomes in a turn-based environment. It was developed as part of the **Modeling and Simulation** course to explore probabilistic modeling through interactive gameplay.

## 🎮 Game Modes
The application includes multiple game modes to showcase different probability behaviors:

- **Standard 2-Player Game**  
  A fair turn-based game using normal, evenly distributed probabilities.

- **Tweaked 2-Player Game**  
  A modified version where probabilities are adjusted to analyze how weighting affects fairness, difficulty, and outcomes.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation Mode**  
  Executes thousands of simulated games to statistically analyze survival rates and outcome distributions.

- **Casino Mode (vs Computer)**  
  A betting-based mode where players wager points against the computer, demonstrating risk and reward under probabilistic conditions.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to **simulate and analyze probability-driven outcomes** by comparing a game with **standard probabilities** against a version with **tweaked probabilities**, highlighting how stochastic modeling impacts game balance and player experience.

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
- Stochastic game simulation  
- Probability and randomness  
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- Game modeling and outcome analysis
